sympyExam is a Python module that uses sympy to generate math questions on topics such as solving trig equations, derivatives and integrals. 
The user chooses the kinds of functions to be included in the question sheet, such as polynomials, trig, rational etc. Then one or more topics need to be chosen (integration, derivatives...). 
Finally, the code generates a pdf file with random questions about the chosen topics.
